# COVID-19 in China
## Data Source
I used web crawler to extract the following data:
- Search intensity of the word "Zoom": [Baidu Index of Zoom](http://index.baidu.com/v2/main/index.html#/trend/zoom?words=zoom)
  It tracks the number of times that "Zoom" was searched from 2011 to 2020.
- Search intensity of the word "Excel": [Baidu Index of Excel](http://index.baidu.com/v2/main/index.html#/trend/excel?words=excel)
  It tracks the number of times that "Excel" was searched from 2011 to 2020.
- Search intensity of the word "telecommuting": [Baidu Index of telecommuting](http://index.baidu.com/v2/main/index.html#/trend/%E8%BF%9C%E7%A8%8B%E5%8A%9E%E5%85%AC?words=%E8%BF%9C%E7%A8%8B%E5%8A%9E%E5%85%AC)
  It tracks the number of times that "telecommuting" was searched from 2011 to 2020.
- Intra-city travel intensity: [Intra-city Travel intensity](https://qianxi.baidu.com/)
   It tracks the intra-city travel intensity of different cities from 2019 to 2020.

I also extracted the data on history of confirmed cases in different countries from R package: [nCov2019](https://github.com/canghailan/Wuhan-2019-nCoV)

## Motivation
I wanted to analyze how the outbreak of COVID-19 impacted the lives of Chinese people from the lens of work, study, and travelling.
Facing the difficulty of retrieving direct data that could reveal how people lived, I chose to analyze intracity travel intensity and search queries, which reflected social behaviours. First, I brainstormed some search queries that were closely related to people's daily lives, then I sorted them into the following categories: work, study and social activities. There were "flight tickets", "telecommuting", "Excel", "lookup", "Excel", "quarantine" etc. Then I chose the most representative term in each category. In the work category, I chose "Excel" because Excel was the most common office software that people use, and more importantly, people search Excel formula frequently, so it's a good indicator of work during the epidemic. I also observed some interesting phenomena about work during the epidemicï¼šinitially, many companies and shops shut down and people stopped working. Then at some point, many companies adopted a new way for employers to work: telecommuting. Even though I had the hypothesis that the search for "Excel" and "telecommuting" might be correlated, I still wanted to know more about when the change happened and why it happened, so I chose "Excel" and "telecommuting" to analyze for work category. In the study category, "Zoom" was chosen because most online classes were provided via Zoom in China and the search for "Zoom" could show the way students studied during the epidemic. For social activities, I wanted to know how the virus impacted people's travelling, so I analyzed the intracity travel intensity in different cities. 

## Data Wrangling
### Search term for "Excel", "telecommuting" and "Zoom"
- Join table Summary with table search_Zoom, table search_Excel, table search_telecommuting based on the date
- Find the first day when the number of confirmed cases exceeded 100
- Find the first day in 2020 when Zoom was searched more than 10000 times
- Find the first day in 2020 when "telecommuting" was searched more than 1000 times
- Find the date when confirmed cases reached the maximum value

### Intracity Travel Intensity 
Here I wanted to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on intracity travel intensity. I chose three big cities(Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou), three small cities (Naning, Wuxi, Guiyang) and Wuhan(the city with the most confirmed cases) so that samples were more representative, which would lead to more general conclusions. 
In the first beginning, I planned to compare the intracity travel intensity before the outbreak of COVID-19 and after the outbreak.
If the intensity decreased significantly, then I would conclude that the COVID-19 affected travel intensity.
However, then I realized one problem: 
The outbreak of COVID-19 occurred during the Chinese New Year holiday. During the Chinese New Year holiday, the travel intensity tends to decline than normal significantly even without the impact of the virus.

Then I tried another way: comparing the intensity level for 2020 to that for 2019 during the Chinese New Year holiday.
If the travel intensity was much lower in 2020 than in 2019, then I would conclude that the COVID-19 affected the travel intensity.
Yet I realized another problem: there may be more or fewer people living in these cities this year than last year. Hence, I couldn't compare the intensity between these two years directly to draw any conclusions, since the population bases were different.

I eventually decided to compare the decline in travel intensity for 2020 to that for 2019.
Yet I encountered another problem: I couldn't compare the intensity in two years based on the Solar calendar due to the impact of the Chinese New Year holiday. For example, it was meaningless to compare the intensity on Jan 24 in 2020 to Jan 24 in 2019. Since on Jan 24, 2020, it was Chinese New Year's Eve and the travelling intensity would be higher than normal, whereas on Jan 24, 2020, no special events occurred and the travel intensity was just normal (Chinese New Year occurs at a different time in different years, according to the Lunar calendar). Hence, the best way to compare 2019 and 2020 was to construct a new timeline according to the Lunar calendar. 
That's why I looked at the time period from Jan 10th,2020 to Feb 7th, 2020 (two weeks before and after the Chinese New Year's Eve in 2020), and the period from Jan 21th,2019 to Feb 18th, 2019 (two weeks before and after the Chinese New Year's Eve in 2019). These two periods were actually the same periods of the year according to the Lunar calendar.
During these periods, if the travel intensity declined more in 2020 than in 2019, then I would conclude that COVID-19 affected travel intensity. I think in this way it could eliminate the impact of the holiday and the difference in population base on travel intensity.

Here are the calculation results from SQL queries:

 City     | Decline in 2019  | Decline in 2020  | Change in decline between 2020 and 2019   
 -------- | :-----------:    | :-----------:    | :-----------:|
 Wuhan    | 0.8186           | 3.6002           | 2.7817       |
 Shanghai | 1.2101           | 3.8416           | 2.6315       |
 Beijing  | 1.1711           | 3.8012           | 2.6301       |
 Guangzhou| 1.8372           | 4.3250           | 2.4878       |
 Naning   | 0.72205          | 2.9822           | 2.2602       |
 Wuxi     | 0.9670           | 3.6338           | 2.6668       |
 Guiyang  | 0.7152           | 2.7435           | 2.0282       |

Based on the table above, we can tell that the intracity travel intensity declined in 2020 more than in 2019 for all the cities.
It implied that COVID-19 decreased travel intensity and impacted people's travelling.
Regarding the impact of the virus on different cities, it's very obvious that the outbreak made a bigger impact on Wuhan than other cities since the change in decline between 2020 and 2019 was the biggest in Wuhan among all the cities.
I had felt and assumed that big cities may be impacted more than small cities, however, it was not completely true based on the table above. 
We can tell that the COVID-19 made a bigger impact on Shanghai and Beijing than most small cities, but there was an exception, Wuxi, that had a larger change in decline than all big cities.
Here are some possible reasons: First, during the outbreak, people across the whole country were discouraged from going out. It was very inconvenient to go out since people had to take temperature wherever they went, and in some places, people even needed to show their ids for records. Hence, it's reasonable to see that there were no big differences among different cities since the impact on travelling didn't depend on whether it's a big city but depending on the national policy. However, despite the national policy, the degree of implementation varied by region. Some local governments ensured more effective implementation of the policy by providing more healthcare publicity and more strict monitor, so people in those cities would reduce the times of travelling. It also depended on the severity of the epidemic in cities. Cities with severe epidemic tended to have very low travel intensity no matter how big the city was, just like Wuhan.
